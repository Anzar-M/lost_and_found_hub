## How It Works
1. Item Lost: A person loses an item.
2. Item Found: Another person finds the item and takes it to the admin office or a designated storage room.
3. Report Item: The finder takes a photo of the item and uploads it to the website with details.
4. Check for Lost Items: The person who lost the item checks the website for any entries matching their lost item.
5. If found, they visit the admin office to collect the item.
6. Admin Action: The website admin deletes the entry once the item is collected.
